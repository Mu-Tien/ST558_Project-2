# Summarize the training data
Here I will show you some summary of my training dataset.\
1. I conduct a histogram of the rental count, since this is my response variable.\
2. I built up a summary table of all the weather measurement.\
3. I also showing the weather summary via a boxplot.\
4. I plot the rental count distributed by time.\
5. I plot the rental count distributed by weather situation.


```{r summarizing data}
# plot the histogram of rental count
hist <- ggplot(data=HourDataTrain, aes(x=cnt))+geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, aes(color=yr))
hist <-hist+labs(title="Histogram of the retal count", x="rental count")
hist <-hist+scale_fill_discrete(labels=c(2011,2012))
hist

#prin out summary table for tempature humidity and windspeed
sum <- HourDataTrain%>% select(c(temp, atemp, hum, windspeed))
kable(apply(sum, 2,summary), caption="Numeric Summary for weather measurement")

```

```{r plotting data}

#plot the boxplot of tempature humidity and windspeed (not genralized amount)
#plot base
boxplot <- ggplot(data = HourDataTrain, aes(x=season))
#adding 4 variables
tem <-boxplot+geom_boxplot(aes(y=temp*41, group=season))+labs(y="Tempature (c)", title = "boxplot for weather measurement")
fetem <-boxplot+geom_boxplot(aes(y=atemp*50, group=season))+labs(y="Feeling Tempature (c)")
hum <-boxplot+geom_boxplot(aes(y=hum*100, group=season))+labs(y="Humidity")
wind <-boxplot+geom_boxplot(aes(y=windspeed*67, group=season))+labs(y="Wind Speed")
#combine 4 plots into 1
ggarrange(tem, fetem, hum , wind, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)

# plot the count distribution among time and weather
# by time
barplot1<-ggplot(data = HourDataTrain, aes(x=hr))+geom_col(aes(y=cnt, fill=yr))+facet_wrap(~mnth)
barplot1 <- barplot1+labs(x="time", y="Rental Count", title="Retal count distribution by month" )

# Training Model
Here I use two different method to train my model. First method is using a tree-based models with leave one out cross validation. For the second method, I use the boosted tree model with cross validation. Both two training are done using the `train` function from `caret` package. The data was cantered and scaled before training. 

## Tree-based model
Since our respons variable is continuous. I use the regression tree model to training my data. The `method= "rpart"` was used in `train` function\
Moreover, because I want to use the leave-one-out cross validation for this training, therefore,the `method= "LOOCV"` was used in `trainControl`.\
We can adjust the grid parameter by ourselves. Since the default result shows that `cp` should be very small to have a lowest RMSE. I set a range [0.0001,0.0005] to fit for every weekday.\
Something to notice, because the `cp` is too small, when I draw my regression tree, it seems like a mess.


```{r tree based model}
# set up training control, using leave one out cross validation.
set.seed(615)
trctrl <- trainControl(method = "LOOCV", number = 1)

# getModelInfo("rpart")
# training using regression tree models with cp in [0.0001,0.0005]
# since the cp seems have to be really small when I used the default cp to train

model1 <- cnt~season+yr+mnth+hr+holiday+weathersit+temp+atemp+hum+windspeed

RegTree_fit1 <- train(model1, data = HourDataTrain, method = "rpart",
                 trControl=trctrl,
                 preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
                 tuneGrid=expand.grid(cp=seq(0.0001,0.0005,0.00004))
)

# show the training result
RegTree_fit1

# plot the RMSE of selected cp
plot(RegTree_fit1)

# plot my final tree model
rpart.plot(RegTree_fit1$finalModel)

```

## Boosted tree model
Here I want to training my data using boosted tree model. The `method= "gbm"` was used in `train` function\
Because I want to use thecross validation for this training, therefore,the `method= "cv"` was used in `trainControl`.\
We can adjust the grid parameter by ourselves. I set a range of number of tree [100,1250] and interaction 5~11 to fit for every weekday.\

```{r boosting tree model, results="hide"}
# set up training control, using cross validation with 10 folder
set.seed(615)
trctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# training using boosted tree models with boosting interation in [700,1250] and try max tree depth 5~9
model2 <- cnt~season+yr+mnth+hr+holiday+weathersit+temp+atemp+hum+windspeed
RegTree_fit2 <- train(model2, data = HourDataTrain, method = "gbm",
                trControl=trctrl,
                preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
                tuneGrid=expand.grid(n.trees=seq(100,1250,25),
                                     interaction.depth=5:11,
                                     shrinkage=0.1, n.minobsinnode=10)
                 )

```
```{r boosted result}

# show the training result of boosted tree
RegTree_fit2$bestTune

# plot the RMSE of different parameters
plot(RegTree_fit2)
